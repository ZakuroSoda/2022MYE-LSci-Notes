## 1. Enzymes

Proteins: Made of interlinked `chains of amino acids` (Polypeptide)

Biological Catalysts: Decreases the activation energy of the reaction, meaning that the reaction will still proceed without enzymes, just *much* slower.

Lock and Key Hypothesis: Substrate must collide and fit perfectly with the active site

Induced Fit Model: Substrate is capable of inducing the proper alignment of the active site of the enzyme

Why organisms use enzymes: We need to speed up life processes, and we can increase the temperature to do that. However, that requires much more energy to sustain that temperature, can damage cells, and also speeds up non-useful reactions. Thus, we use enzymes that reduce the activation energy of the reaction.

Quick Note: Protease refers to enzymes which break down protein such as bromelain (pineapple), and pepsin.

Quick Note: Lactose intolerant persons lack enough lactase to break down the lactose they injest.

Example:

Starch (Substrate) [Complex Carbohydrate] => Iodine test appears as *blue-black*.

OR

Starch (Substrate) [Complex Carbohydrate] => Using Amylase => Maltose => Using Maltase => Glucose => Iodine test appears as *brown*.

Enzyme Inhibitors: 

Many medicines contain these. They can be broken down into competitve and non-competitive inhibitors. 

Competitive Inhibitors:

- Binds to the active site of enzyme so that the substrate is unable to bind to the enzyme
- Does *not* change the shape of the active site but changes the shape *available* for the substrate to bind to

- Statins (Cholestrol Reduction - Block the production of cholestrol)

Non-Compeitive Inhibitors:

- Binds to other parts of the enzyme so that the substrate is unable to bind to the enzyme 
- Changes the shape of the enzyme and its active site 

- Cyanide (Kills - Blocks the synthesis of ATP)
- Arsenic
- Heavy Metals
- Salt (On Bromelain)
