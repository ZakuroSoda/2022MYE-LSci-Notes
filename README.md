## 1. Enzymes

Proteins: Made of interlinked `chains of amino acids` (Polypeptide)

Biological Catalysts: Decreases the activation energy of the reaction, meaning that the reaction will still proceed without enzymes, just *much* slower.

Lock and Key Hypothesis: Substrate must collide and fit perfectly with the active site

Induced Fit Model: Substrate is capable of inducing the proper alignment of the active site of the enzyme

Why organisms use enzymes: We need to speed up life processes, and we can increase the temperature to do that. However, that requires much more energy to sustain that temperature, can damage cells, and also speeds up non-useful reactions. Thus, we use enzymes that reduce the activation energy of the reaction.

Quick Note: Protease refers to enzymes which break down protein such as bromelain (pineapple), and pepsin.

Quick Note: Lactose intolerant persons lack enough lactase to break down the lactose they injest.

Example:

Starch (Substrate) [Complex Carbohydrate] => Iodine test appears as *blue-black*.

OR

Starch (Substrate) [Complex Carbohydrate] => Using Amylase => Maltose => Using Maltase => Glucose => Iodine test appears as *brown*.

Enzyme Inhibitors: 

Many medicines contain these. They can be broken down into competitve and non-competitive inhibitors. 

Competitive Inhibitors:

- Binds to the active site of enzyme so that the substrate is unable to bind to the enzyme
- Does *not* change the shape of the active site but changes the shape *available* for the substrate to bind to

- Statins (Cholestrol Reduction - Block the production of cholestrol)

Non-Compeitive Inhibitors:

- Binds to other parts of the enzyme so that the substrate is unable to bind to the enzyme 
- Changes the shape of the enzyme and its active site 

- Cyanide (Kills - Blocks the synthesis of ATP)
- Arsenic
- Heavy Metals
- Salt (On Bromelain)

## 2. Cellular Transport

Quick Note: Net means overall movement. This means that particles still move between the two areas, but there is overall no change in concentration of that particle in the two areas.

Diffusion Example 1 - Plant in the day:

CO<sub>2</sub> - Atmosphere => Intra-Cellular Airspaces within the leaf

O<sub>2</sub> - Intra-Cellular Airspaces => Atmosphere

Diffusion Example 2: Plant in the night:

CO<sub>2</sub> - Intra-Cellular Airspaces => Atmosphere within the leaf

O<sub>2</sub> - Atmosphere => Intra-Cellular Airspaces

Diffusion Example 3 - Human Lungs:

CO<sub>2</sub> - Bloodstream => Air (Airsac)

O<sub>2</sub> - Air (Airsac) => Bloodstream

Written out:

Faster rate of photosynthesis than respiration on bright afternoon so higher concentration of oxygen and lower concentration of carbon dioxide occurs in the leaf intracellular air-space compared to the exterior atmosphere. [1]
Thus, there is diffusion of carbon dioxide into the air-space through the stomata down the concentration gradient. [1]

Facilitated Diffusion Example 1:

When Glucose and Amino Acids digested from food are higher in concentration in the small intestine than the bloodstream, they travel through the walls into the bloodstream through facilitated diffusion because they are still quite big.

Active Transport Example 1:

When Glucose and Amino Acids digested from food are lower in concentration in the small intestine than the bloodstream, they travel through the walls into the bloodstream through active transport.

Active Transport Example 2:

Nutrients travel from the soil into the root (hair cells) through active transport.

Diffusion is usually the most "diverse" and can occur in liquids, gas, semi-solids (agar), with or without a partially-permeable membrane, since it is not a live process (like F.D. and A.C. which inherently require live stuff). 

Active transport functions like a pump. It uses *transport carrier proteins*
