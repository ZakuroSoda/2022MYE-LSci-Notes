## 1. Enzymes

Proteins: Made of interlinked `chains of amino acids` (Polypeptide)

Biological Catalysts: Decreases the activation energy of the reaction, meaning that the reaction will still proceed without enzymes, just *much* slower.

Lock and Key Hypothesis: Substrate must collide and fit perfectly with the active site

Induced Fit Model: Substrate is capable of inducing the proper alignment of the active site of the enzyme

Why organisms use enzymes: We need to speed up life processes, and we can increase the temperature to do that. However, that requires much more energy to sustain that temperature, can damage cells, and also speeds up non-useful reactions. Thus, we use enzymes that reduce the activation energy of the reaction.

Quick Note: Protease refers to enzymes which break down protein such as bromelain (pineapple), and pepsin.

Quick Note: Lactose intolerant persons lack enough lactase to break down the lactose they injest.

Example:

Starch (Substrate) [Complex Carbohydrate] => Iodine test appears as *blue-black*.

OR

Starch (Substrate) [Complex Carbohydrate] => Using Amylase => Maltose => Using Maltase => Glucose => Iodine test appears as *brown*.

Enzyme Inhibitors: 

Many medicines contain these. They can be broken down into competitve and non-competitive inhibitors. 

Competitive Inhibitors:

- Binds to the active site of enzyme so that the substrate is unable to bind to the enzyme
- Does *not* change the shape of the active site but changes the shape *available* for the substrate to bind to

- Statins (Cholestrol Reduction - Block the production of cholestrol)

Non-Compeitive Inhibitors:

- Binds to other parts of the enzyme so that the substrate is unable to bind to the enzyme 
- Changes the shape of the enzyme and its active site 

- Cyanide (Kills - Blocks the synthesis of ATP)
- Arsenic
- Heavy Metals
- Salt (On Bromelain)

## 2. Cellular Transport

Quick Note: Net means overall movement. This means that particles still move between the two areas, but there is overall no change in concentration of that particle in the two areas. This applies for both diffusion and osmosis.

Diffusion Example 1 - Plant in the day:

CO<sub>2</sub> - Atmosphere => Intra-Cellular Airspaces within the leaf

O<sub>2</sub> - Intra-Cellular Airspaces => Atmosphere

Diffusion Example 2: Plant in the night:

CO<sub>2</sub> - Intra-Cellular Airspaces => Atmosphere within the leaf

O<sub>2</sub> - Atmosphere => Intra-Cellular Airspaces

Diffusion Example 3 - Human Lungs:

CO<sub>2</sub> - Bloodstream => Air (Airsac)

O<sub>2</sub> - Air (Airsac) => Bloodstream

Written out:

Faster rate of photosynthesis than respiration on bright afternoon so higher concentration of oxygen and lower concentration of carbon dioxide occurs in the leaf intracellular air-space compared to the exterior atmosphere. [1]
Thus, there is diffusion of carbon dioxide into the air-space through the stomata down the concentration gradient. [1]

Facilitated Diffusion Example 1:

When Glucose and Amino Acids digested from food are higher in concentration in the small intestine than the bloodstream, they travel through the walls into the bloodstream through facilitated diffusion because they are still quite big.

Active Transport Example 1:

When Glucose and Amino Acids digested from food are lower in concentration in the small intestine than the bloodstream, they travel through the walls into the bloodstream through active transport.

Active Transport Example 2:

Nutrients travel from the soil into the root (hair cells) through active transport.

Diffusion is usually the most "diverse" and can occur in liquids, gas, semi-solids (agar), with or without a partially-permeable membrane, since it is not a live process (like F.D. and A.C. which inherently require live stuff). 

Facilitated Diffusion is also suited for bringing *large and charged particles like ions* across the cell membrane, using *protein channels*.

Active transport functions like a pump. It uses *transport carrier proteins* to bring *large and charged* particles across the membrane. These could be *ions in the nerves* to send signals. They could also be *ionic sodium and potassium*, pumping Na+ out of the cell and K+ into the cell, against the concentration gradient. 
A.T. ensures *electrostatic equilibrium*.

Factors affecting the rate of diffusion/osmosis *(Passive Processes)*

- Temperature

As the temperature increases,the rate of the process increases. Molecules move faster when temperature increases hence leading to a faster rate of diffusion/osmosis.

- Concentration Gradient Difference

As the concentration gradient increases,the rate of the process increases. More molecules will be crossing over the regions hence leading to a faster rate of diffusion/osmosis.

- Surface Area to Volume Ratio

As the surface area to volume ratio increases,the rate of the process increases. More surface area and shorter distance for particle to move from inside of cell to outside of cell and vice versa, hence leading to a faster rate of diffusion/osmosis.

- Distance

The distance that the particles have to travel affect the rate of process, for example if the room is bigger, it will take longer for a smell to diffuse throughout the room.

- Characteristics of Solvent

Eg. Molecular Weight or Viscosity

- Characteristics of Substance

Eg. Molecular Weight

- Characteristics of Barrier

Eg. Polar or Non-Polar, Thickness

The definition of osmosis is already in the book together with the table so...

The presence of a partially permeable membrane restricts diffusion of solute particles (sodium ions). Osmosis will occur instead, where water molecules move from a less concentrated solution (pure water) to a more concentrated solution (sodium solution) to "balance" out the water to solute ratio. 

This means that if there was no *partially-permeable membrane*, the sodium ions would simply diffuse throughout the solution, which is why we say that *osmosis requires a partially-permeable membrane*.
 
<img src="assets/Water_osmosis.png" width=400px>

In the sodium solution, water molecules are held around the sodium ions, giving it "less potential" to move around the solution. In pure water however, water molecules move around more freely and therefore has "more potential". Hence, water molecules move from an area of higher water potential to an area of lower water potential. 
 
The more concentrated a solution is, the lower its water potential. So:

Low Solute Concentration => High Water "Concentration" => High Water Potential

High Solute Concentration => Low Water "Concentration" => Low Water Potential

Quick Note: We must always say that something is hypertonic **to** or hypotonic **to** something else.

Animal Cells Terms:
1. Shrunken/Crenated
2. Normal (Best)
3. Swell and Burst/Lyse

Plant Cells Terms:
1. Plasmolysis (Occurs when  cell *membrane* pulls away from the cell wall)
2. Flaccid (Occus when cell *contents* pull away from cell wall)
3. Turgid (Best)

## 3. Nutrition in Plants

Quick Note: The *duration* of light mainly affects the initation of flowering. Long-Day Plants such as wheats and oats only bloom when the duration of light they receive is more than 12 hours or the critical period. Short-Day Plants such as tobacco, soybeans and chrysanthemum only bloom when the duration of light they receive is less than 12 hours or the critical period. There are also day-neutral plants like tomatoes, maize (corn), cucumbers, sunflowers and some strawberries which form flowers regardless of day length.

Quick Note: Three aspects of light - Quality (Wavelength), Intensity (Brightness), Duration (Photoperiod).

Quick Note: In the lab, the reason why magenta lights are usually used is because red and blue is best utilised by plants for photosynthesis. Green is least-utilised because most of it is reflected (That is why the leaves look green).

All these nutrients are necessary, just needed in different amounts.

Mineral nutrients are taken in through the process of active transport by the root hair cells.

What each primary macronutrient does and its characteristics (In addition to stuff in the notes booklet):

Nitrogen:
- Dark green, glossy look
- Easily leaves the soil
- Mobile in plants

Phosphorus:
- Root formation and growth
- Quality of Seed, Fruits and Flowers
- Disease Resistance

Potassium:
- Overcome drought stress
- Winter Hardness
- Disease Resistance
- Strength of Stems



## 4. Seed Structure and Germination

Flowering plants can be split into monocotyledonous plants and dicotyledonous plants. (Non-flowering plants obviously don't make seeds).

Monocotyledonous Plants:
- wheat
- asparagus
- corn (maize)
- rice
- millet
- lilies
- daffodils
- sugarcane
- banana
- palm
- ginger
- onions
- bamboo
- sugarcane
- cone
- palm tree
- banana tree
- grass

Dicotyledonous Plants:
- soybean
- broad bean
- peas
- almonds
- cashews
- grapes
- apples
- chestnut
- oak
- carrot
- rose
- hollyhock

The cotyledons provide nourishment for the germinating plant.

A seed can be broken down into three main parts, the embryo, the seed coat, and the cotyledon.

The embryo is the living thing, that will grow into a plant.

From the "top-down", a embryo consists of
1. Plumule - The part that becomes the shoot
2. Epicotyl (Above)
3. Hypocotyl (Below)
4. Radicle - Attracted by gravity, becomes the root.

The seedcoat consists of
1. Outer testa (Hard and Thick)
2. Inner tegmen (Thin Whitish Membrane)
which are fused.

Usually we refer to the seedcoat as the testa. It protects the embryo.

The cotyledons in a dicotyledonous plant are connected along an embryonic axis, which consists of the
1. Raphe (The line or scar running across the seed)
2. Micropyle (Pore, usually below the hilum)
3. Hilum (Attachment to the original plant's ovary wall)
